# Welcome to Laravel-Dockerized Public docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!
As this project aims to provide any needed service ready out of the box so feel free to make an issue and talk about having a new seervi in the project.
Then you can implement that and finally put it in the docker-compose.
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
adding a new service have to go through issues and the branch name shoudl be the same as the issue title so we define a formt for issue titles:

##### Issue defining naming convention:
- [ always general:to:specific (feature first) ]
- [ stick to namespaces that already exist if possible ]
- [ use kebab case instead of snake case or camel case ]
